* What about globals/namespaces?  how do we @extend? (2 different left nav modes?)
** namespaces are determined by @static and @class
* We should document import examples to make it obvious how to use.
* TODO: Url processing for "@"(url encode)
* What to do about sub-packages?  Submodules?
** Do we want exisiting submodules gone?(ember-glimmer, ember-metal, ember-routing)
* TODO: change processing for submodules
** We want to show top level modules, but not all submodules (at least on the top level).
** List submodules nested underneath?
* How to handle function exports with no class?  ex. polyfills
** Can we document a function without pinning it to a class?
