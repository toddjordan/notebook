* Test Pyramid

* Test at the lowest level of the pyramid that validates the test.

* Test Pyramid Levels + What 

* Acceptance What it does

** Very good talk by Mark https://apps.mypurecloud.com/s/#/1/m5ulbrmjdvcphcrg6l44bwznem

* How Async works in acceptance

** Async Helpers 

*** visit, click, fillIn

** Async "waits" 

*** routes, timers, ajax, waiters

*** pause on a wait to see the logic

* Using Mirage

** Routes, db, schema

** Accomodating Multi-user

** recording data flow

** static responses -> factories

** Varying data per test




* Creating a new Acceptance Test

** ember g acceptance-test <name>

* Running Tests

** npm test

** npm run acceptance

* Debugging Tests

** pauseTest()/resumeTest()

** breakpoints

** mirage logs

** stuckness - pause button, async debug tools
* Keeping Acceptance Tests Working

** For long running async tests, provide an alternative that can be injected at test time.

*** Ember.testing

*** reopen to provide alternate impls

* For Engines

** Mounting an engine in dummy

** defining dependant services

*** mocking them in dummy resolver (or by creating them)
