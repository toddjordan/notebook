* Create an Web Application Platform in 15 minutes using Ember Engines
Ember Engines is a new technology built into the Ember Web Framework that allows an application to seamlessly integration sub-applications.  
Engines allow different applications to be bound in a single UI and share common services and routing.
In this short talk we will demonstrate the power of engines by creating a simpla application platform.
The application platform will allow developers to install and integrate one or more applications into its existing shell.

** Create the ember application shell app
** Create a new engine
** Update addon to write to config
** Install the engine into the application shell
