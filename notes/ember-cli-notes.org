* Ember CLI Notes                                                     :notes:
** Broccoli Visualizations

BROCCOLI_VIZ=true ember build
dot -Tpng graph.0.dot -o graph.0.png

included hook (addon)
when ember instance is constructed, and when the addons are discovered and inited, used to bring in additional dependencies

** Broccoli stew debug

const debug = require('broccoli-stew').debug;
commonLess = debug(commonLess, {name: 'commonLess'});

** treeFor hooks

consuming project always wins

treeForAddon allows an app to exclude parts of addons it doesn't need

broccoli-stew - lets you debug by leaving around tree folders

use preProcess/postProcess hooks to insert code before/after node processing.

** Running DEBUG

DEBUG=* ember s

** Built-in Debugger

node debug node_modules/ember-cli/bin/ember <command>
